### 136.Single Number

The logic i apply for this problem is 

1. Firstly Iterate loop and calculate count for each element whoever count is greater than  one continue the iterations otherwise if cnt of element  is exact one store it in another varable and return that variable.

so it wil print the number who is not reapeat in array or single Number in array.
