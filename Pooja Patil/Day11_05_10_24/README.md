# Length of Last Word

in this program we have to find the last word length of String: 

_ : WhiteSpace.

for Example :

str = "Welcome to new World"
len = 5

str = a_
len = 1

Logic I apply for this problem.

I take For loop and cheak the String if There is Any whiteSpace Present.

if whiteSpace is Present continue the loop ...So the WhiteSpace is skiped and iteration continue.

else store the Charater into new String.
