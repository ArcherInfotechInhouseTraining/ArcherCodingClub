# Phone Directory

## Overview
This Java program implements a simple phone directory that stores names and phone numbers. Users can query the directory by name, and the program will return the corresponding phone number if it exists, or indicate that the entry is not found.

## Files
- **Solution.java**: Contains the main program, which reads names and phone numbers, stores them in a `HashMap`, and allows users to query the directory.

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Solution.java
