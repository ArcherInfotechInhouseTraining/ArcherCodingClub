# List Manipulation Program

## Overview
This Java program allows users to create a list of integers and then manipulate it with `Insert` and `Delete` operations. The user specifies the initial list, followed by a series of commands to modify the list, and the program outputs the final state of the list.

## Files
- **Solution.java**: Contains the main program, which reads input, performs the specified operations on the list, and prints the modified list.

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Solution.java
