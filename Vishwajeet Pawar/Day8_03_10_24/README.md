## Find Day Program
- This is a Java program that determines the day of the week for a given date (month, day, and year). The program takes a date as input and returns the day of the week in all caps (e.g., "SUNDAY", "MONDAY").

### How It Works
- The program accepts three parameters:

- month - The month of the date (1-12).
-day - The day of the month (1-31).
- year - The year of the date.
- The findDay function processes these parameters, converts them into a valid calendar date, and then determines the corresponding day of the week. The result is returned as a string in uppercase format (e.g., "MONDAY").

### Program Structure
- The project contains the following files:

- Solution.java: Contains the main method that reads input from the console and writes the output to a file.
- Result.java: Contains the findDay function that performs the logic of calculating the day of the week.
