# Anagram Checker

## Overview
This Java program checks if two strings are anagrams. Two strings are considered anagrams if they can be rearranged to form each other, meaning they contain the same characters with the same frequencies, regardless of order or case.

## Files
- **Solution.java**: Contains the main program with the `isAnagram` function, which performs the anagram check, and the `main` function to handle input and output.

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Solution.java
