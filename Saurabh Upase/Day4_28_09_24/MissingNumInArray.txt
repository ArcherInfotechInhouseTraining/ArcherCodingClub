Day-4
Given an array arr of size nâˆ’1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive), find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: n = 2, arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 2 are present except 2.


Output:-

int missingNumber(int n, int arr[]) {

    // Your code goes here
    int sum=0;
    int total=(n*(n+1))/2;
    
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
    {
        sum+=arr[i];
    }
    
    return (total-sum);
}
