## Logic For Stairs Problem

   Here i have used Fibonacci serias logic.

   i.e.
     a=0,b=1,sum=a+b;
     after this we need to do swaping,

     a = b;
     b = sum;
     sum = a+b;

     first  we need to initialize i=1 and do above step until our i is not become a greater than A,

     e.g.

     A = 4;

     a=0, b=1, sum = a+b;

     sum = 0+1 ; // sum=1

   i=1      a=b         b=sum           sum=a+b       
    1        1             1                2                              
    2        1             2                3      
    3        2             3                5

here we get our answer 5
