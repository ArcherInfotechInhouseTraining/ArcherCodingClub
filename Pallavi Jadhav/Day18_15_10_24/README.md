## Logic For Rotate Matrix Problem

Transpose the matrix:

Convert rows into columns.

For example, in the matrix:

      [1, 2]
      [3, 4]

  After transposition, it becomes:

      [1, 3]
      [2, 4]


Reverse each row:

    After transposing the matrix, reverse each row to complete the 90-degree rotation.

    Continuing the example above:

      [1, 3]
      [2, 4]

    After reversing the rows:

        [3, 1]
        [4, 2]

        Now the matrix is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.
