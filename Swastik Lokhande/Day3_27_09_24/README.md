# findNumbers Method Description

This Java method, `findNumbers`, is designed to accept two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, and returns an array of two-digit positive numbers between them that meet certain conditions. Below is a detailed description of the method, its implementation, and how it works.

## Method Details

- **Method Name**: `findNumbers`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `int num1`: The starting value for the range.
  - `int num2`: The ending value for the range.

### Validation Rules

- **Condition 1**: `num1` should be less than `num2`.
  - If `num1` is not less than `num2`, the validation fails, and the method should return an empty array or an appropriate error.
  
### Filtering Conditions

If the validation is successful, populate the `numbers` array with all two-digit positive numbers between `num1` and `num2` that satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Sum of the Digits is a Multiple of 3**: 
   - For a two-digit number, calculate the sum of the digits and check if it is divisible by 3.

2. **Number is a Multiple of 5**:
   - The number itself must be divisible by 5.

### Method Functionality

The method should iterate through the range between `num1` and `num2` (excluding `num1` and `num2`), identify the numbers that meet the conditions, and return them in an array called `numbers`.
